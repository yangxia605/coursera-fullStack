#### responsive web
  A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
  The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
  The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
#### tips: the jquery script order must in the first.
